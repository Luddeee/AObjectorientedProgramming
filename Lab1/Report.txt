Polymorphism has the ability to select diffrent methods 
that fits the actual type of the object sent in. 
multiple classes can implement the same interface. 
with these classes we have the ability to choose an 
interface that the type requires. witch makes it possible
for the program to operate on a mixture of object from
these classes. this behavoir is called polymorphism.
